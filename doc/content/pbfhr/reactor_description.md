# Description of the Mk1 PB-FHR

The Mk1 PB-FHR is a pre-conceptual design of a fluoride salt cooled high temperature reactor.
Its objective is to study numerous potential benefits of the FHR technology, with regards to
efficiency, safety and construction. Within the scope of the virtual test bed, we aim to assess
its safety performance in design-basis and beyond design-basis accidents.
