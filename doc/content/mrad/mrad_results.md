# Multiphysics results

A multiphysics steady-state analysis was completed in the full-core model by coupling the Bison thermo-mechanical solver to the Sockeye heat-pipe thermal performance solver. 

The following picture displays the temperature throughout the core at steady-state... [Work in progress]
